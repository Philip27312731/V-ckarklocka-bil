This project is a moving alarm clock designed to wake up the user by driving away when the alarm is triggered.
 It uses an RTC module to keep track of time, relays to control motors, and a piezo buzzer to sound the alarm.
The alarm can be stopped by pressing a button, which will turn off the motors and the buzzer.
The system includes debounce logic to ensure reliable button press detection.
